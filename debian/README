The Debian Package teams-guest-login
----------------------------

Once an authorized microsoft user logged in to microsoft services
from your computer/account, microsoft makes it really hard to
join a Teams-Meeting just via guest login. In this case microsoft
typically asks for login credentials which could be very annoying
if one just want to join annonymously.

To ensure we are logged in via guest login, the teams link has to
be opened in an incognito browser - and this is what this tiny
wrapper (and handler for "msteams:" urls) does.
